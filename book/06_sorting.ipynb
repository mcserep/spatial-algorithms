    "In computer science, the analysis of algorithms is the process of finding the computational complexity of algorithms: the **amount of time, storage**, or other resources needed to execute them.\n",
    "Usually, this involves determining a function that relates the length of an algorithm's input to the number of steps it takes (its **time complexity**) or the number of storage locations it uses (its **space complexity**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will focus on **time complexity**. Let $f$ and $g$ represent the time complexity of 2 algorithms and we would like to make statements on how they grow compared to each other. (E.g. the time complexity of the *bubble sort* grows no faster than the $n^2$ function.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In theoretical analysis of algorithms it is common to estimate their complexity in the *asymptotic sense*, i.e., to estimate the complexity function for arbitrarily large input. We are not concerned with small inputs or constant factors. The following notations are used to this end:\n",
    " - **Big O ($O$) notation** describes the *asympthotic upper bound*, meaning that $f(N) = O(g(N))$, if such positive constants $c$ and $N_0$ exists, that $f(N) \\leq c * g(N)$, for all $N \\ge N_0$.\n",
    " - **Big-omega ($\\Omega$) notation** describes the *asympthotic lower bound*, meaning that $f(N) = O(g(N))$, if such positive constants $c$ and $N_0$ exists, that $f(N) \\ge c * g(N)$, for all $N \\ge N_0$.\n",
    " - **Big-theta ($\\Theta$) notation** describes the *asympthotic tight bound*, meaning that $f(N) = O(g(N))$, if such positive constants $c_1$, $c_2$ and $N_0$ exists, that $c_1 * g(N) \\leq f(N) \\leq c_2 * g(N)$, for all $N \\ge N_0$.\n",
