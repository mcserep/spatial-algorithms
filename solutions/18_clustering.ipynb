    "### K-Means clustering algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The *K-Means* method is one of the most common unsupervised classification approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm requires an arbitrarily specified initial cluster centres that are represented by the means of the data points assigned to them.\n",
    "As a naïve solution, the user only defines the number of clusters and random data points are selected as their initial centers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will generate a very crude set of clusters. The data points are then reassigned to the cluster with the closest center, and the centers are recomputed.\n",
    "The process is repeated as many times as necessary such that there is no further movement of the data points between clusters.\n",
    "In practice, with large data sets, the process is not run to completion and some other stopping rule is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the squared distance between each data point and the respective cluster center as the *squared error*, the sum of squared errors (*SSE*) progressively reduces with each iteration. If the *Euclidean distance* is used as a metric, this simply means to accumulate the squared distances for all points and their respective cluster center.\n",
    "\n",
    "![K-Means](../images/18_kmeans.gif \"Source: https://simplystatistics.org/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Although no general proof of convergence exists for this algorithm, it can be expected to yield acceptable results when the data exhibit characteristic pockets which are relatively far from each other.\n",
    "In most practical cases the application of this algorithm will require experimenting with various values of inital clusters (the value of $k$), as well as different choices of starting configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Clustering raster data\n",
    "\n",
    "The K-Means method can be use with an arbitrary *distance function*. For raster imagery the distance is computed as if the pixel values were coordinates. For example, if the insensity values of two RGB pixels were $(25,42,37)$ and $(31,40,32)$, the squared distance would be $(25-31)^2 + (42-40)^2 + (37-32)^2 = 65$ in the 3 dimensional spectral space, no matter where the pixels were in relation to each other spatially."

    "### Elbow method\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most challenging tasks in the K-Means clustering algorithm is to choose the right value of the clusters (the value of $k$). What should be the right value of $k$ and how to choose it?\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Elbow Method* is one of the most popular methods to determine the optimal value of $k$.\n",
    "The idea is to run K-Means clustering on the dataset for a range of values of $k$ (e.g. from 1 to 10), and for each value of $k$ calculate the sum of squared errors (*SSE*).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, visualize a line chart of the SSE for each value of $k$. If the line chart looks like an arm, then the \"elbow\" on the arm is the value of $k$ that is the best. The idea is that we want a small SSE, but that the SSE tends to decrease toward 0 as we increase $k$. (The SSE is $0$ when $k$ is equal to the number of data points in the dataset, because then each data point has its own cluster, and there is no error between it and the center of its cluster.)\n",
    "Hence we select the value of $k$ at the “elbow”, i.e. the point after which the line chart starts decreasing in a linear fashion.\n",
