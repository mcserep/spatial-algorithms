    "The convex hull of a set of points, is the smallest convex polygon for which each point in the set is either on the boundary of the polygon or in its interior.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can visualize what the convex hull looks like by imagining that the points are nails sticking out of the plane.\n",
    "Take an elastic rubber band, stretch it around the nails and let it go.\n",
    "It will snap around the nails and assume a shape that minimizes its length.\n",
    "The area enclosed by the rubber band is called the convex hull of the points.\n",
    "This leads to an alternative definition of the convex hull of a finite set of points in the plane: it is the unique convex polygon whose vertices are points from and which contains all points.\n",

    "## Graham's scan\n",
    "\n",
    "Graham’s scan solves the convex-hull problem by maintaining a stack of candidate points.\n",
    "It pushes each point of the input set onto the stack one time, and it eventually pops from the stack each point that is not a vertex of the convex hull.\n",
    "When the algorithm terminates, the stack contains exactly the vertices of the convex hull, in counter-clockwise order of their appearance on the boundary.\n",
    "The algorithm is named after Ronald Graham, who published the original version in 1972.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm consists of 3 steps:\n",
    " 1. Find the point with the lowest Y-coordinate, picking the leftmost such point in case of a tie.\n",
    "Call this point $P$.\n",
    " 2. The set of points must be sorted in increasing order of the angle they and the point $P$ make with the X-axis. (Sorting algorithm were discussed in [Chapter 6](06_sorting.ipynb).)\n",
    " 3. Initiate an empty stack. Then consider each points in the sorted list in sequence iteratively. For each point, it is first determined whether traveling from the two points immediately preceding this point constitutes making a left turn or a right turn in orientation.\n",
    "    - If a left turn, push the point onto the stack.\n",
    "    - If a right turn, the second-to-last point is not part of the convex hull (lies inside it), and is therefore removed from the stack. The same determination is then made for the set of the latest point, and the two points that immediately precede the point found to have been inside the hull, and is repeated until a left turn set is encountered, at which point the algorithm moves on to the next point in the set of points in the sorted list.\n",

    "The original algorithm was described by Scott Greenfield in 1990. The algorithm was later extended to work in n-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm contains the following steps:\n",
    " 1. Find the points with minimum and maximum X-coordinates, as these will always be part of the convex hull. If case of a tie, pick the ones with minimum/maximum Y-coordinates correspondingly.\n",
    " 2. Use the line formed by these two points to divide the set in two subsets of points, which will be processed recursively (*\"divide and conquer\"*).\n",
    " 3. For both sides, determine the point with the maximum distance from the line. This point forms a triangle with those of the line. The points lying inside of that triangle cannot be part of the convex hull and can therefore be ignored in the next steps.\n",
    " 4. Repeat the previous step on the two lines formed by the triangle.\n",
    " 5. Continue the recursion until no more points are left. In the end, all points selected constitute the convex hull.\n",
